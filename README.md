# Logistic-Regression-
* Analyzed a diabtes dataset to determine whether an observation has diabtes using logistic regression 
* Split dataset into training and testing subsets 
* Utilized ROCR package to determine best threshold and performance for the model
* Created a plot of the performance using true positive rate and false positive rate for the axes to determine best threshold for the model and reduce the false positive rate
