# Logistic-Regression-
* Analyzed a diabetes dataset with the goal of predicting a binary response variable - whether an observation has diabetes using logistic regression 
* Split dataset into training and testing subsets 
* Utilized ROCR package to determine best threshold and performance for the model
* Created a ROC curve plot to determine the best probability threshold for the model and reduce the false positive rate 
* Accuracy of the model was .76
